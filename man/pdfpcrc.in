.SH NAME
pdfpcrc \- pdfpc configuration file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpdfpc\fR(1) first reads its system-wide configuration file, followed by the
user-specific one if it exists.

.SS Keybindings
.PP
The following commands are accepted:
.TP
.B bind <key> <action> [<arg>]
Bind a key to an action, passing a specified argument for actions that require
one
.TP
.B unbind <key>
Unbind the given key
.TP
.B unbind_all
Clear all the key bindings
.TP
.B mouse <button> <action>
Bind a mouse button to an action
.TP
.B unmouse <button>
Unbind a mouse button
.TP
.B unmouse_all
Clear all the mouse bindings

.PP
Key names can be obtained with the help of the \fBxev\fR(1) utility. Note that
names are case sensitive. Key combinations with modifiers can be specified in
the form <mod>+<key>, where <mod> is one of S (for shift), C (for control) and
A/M (for Alt/Meta).

.PP
A shorthand for specifying key combinations constituting shift and an
alphabetic character is to simply give the uppercase version of the
alphabetic character. For example, S+r and R are equivalent.

.PP
A list of all possible actions can be obtained via the \fB\-L\fR command line
option of \fBpdfpc\fR(1). Use the \fB\-B\fR command line option to list the
action bindings defined.

.SS Options
.PP
Some permanent changes can be configured via the config file. The syntax is:
.TP
.B option <option_name> <option_value>

.PP
The following option_name's are recognized:

.TP

.BI cache-clean-period
Period (in units of s) to check for expired cached content (int, Default is 60).
.TP
.BI cache-expiration
Time (in units of s) to keep (pre)rendered slides in the cache (int, Default is
600). Set to a negative value to keep cached slides permanently.
.TP
.BI cache-max-rtime
Maximal time (in units of ms) it takes to render a slide for its cache to be
protected from expiration (int, Default is 1000).
.TP
.BI cache-min-rtime
Minimal time (in units of ms) it takes to render a slide for it to be cached
(int, Default is 10).

Maximal size (in units of kB) of a slide image to store it uncompressed in the
cache (int, Default is 256).
.TP
.B current-height
Percentage of the height of the "main" presenter area to be used for the current
slide (int, Default is 80).
.TP
.B current-size
Percentage of the width of the presenter screen to be used for the current slide
(int, Default is 60).

Do not automatically detect type (pen or eraser) of tablet input devices (bool,
Default is false).
.TP

managers (e.g., FVWM) ignore the placement if made before the window is
