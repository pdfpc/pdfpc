.SH NAME
pdfpc \- pdf presenter console with multi-monitor support

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdfpc
[options] PDF-file

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
pdfpc is a GTK based presentation viewer application which uses Keynote
like multi-monitor output to provide meta information to the speaker
during the presentation.
It is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen, while
showing a more sophisticated overview on the other one providing
information like a picture of the next slide, as well as the left over
time till the end of the presentation.
The input files processed by pdfpc are PDF documents, which can be
created using nearly any of today\[aq]s presentation software.
.PP
To run pdfppc, simply type
.RS
.PP
pdfpc file.pdf

.SH FEATURES

.SS Caching / Pre-rendering

To allow fast changes between the different slides of the presentation the pdf
pages are pre-rendered to memory.  The progress bar on the bottom of the
presenter screen indicates how many percent of the slides have been
pre-rendered already.  During the initial rendering phase this will slow down
slide changes, as most cpu power is used for the rendering process in the
background.  After the cache is fully primed however the changing of slides
should be much faster, as with normal pdf viewers.

As the pre-rendering takes a lot of memory it can be disabled using the
\-\-disable\-cache switch at the cost of speed.
.SS Cache compression

The pre-rendered and cached slides can be compressed in memory to save up some
memory.  Without compression a set of about 100 pdf pages can easily grow up to
about 1.5gb size.  Netbooks with only 1gb of memory would swap themselves to
death if pre-rendering is enabled in such a situation.  The compression is
enabled by default as it does not harm rendering speed in a noticeable way on
most systems.  It does however slows down pre-rendering by about a factor of 2.
If you have got enough memory and want to ensure the fastest possible
pre-rendering you can disable slide compression by using the \-z switch. But be
warned using the uncompressed pre-rendering storage will use about 30 times the
memory the new compressed storage utilizes (aka the 1.5gb become about 50mb)

.SS Timer
If a duration is given (\-d option), the timer will show a countdown with the
given parameters.  If no duration is specified (or if a value of 0 is given to
the \-d option), the timer will show how much time has been spent.  The duration
is stored automatically, so you do not need to repeat it for every invocation.

The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first page for the
first time.  This feature is quite useful as you may want to show the titlepage
of your presentation while people are still entering the room and the
presentation hasn\[aq]t really begun yet.  If you want to start over you can
use the r key which will make the presenter reset the timer.

If a duration is given, at the moment the timer reaches the defined
last-minutes value it will change color to indicate your talk is nearing its
end.  As soon as the timer reaches the zero mark (00:00:00) it will turn red
and count further down showing a negative time, to provide information on how
many minutes you are overtime.

.SS Notes

Textual notes can be displayed for each slide.  While in the presentation,
pressing n will allow you to take notes for the screen.  To go out of editing
mode, press the Escape key.  Note that while editing a note the keybindings
stop working, i.e.  you are not able to change slides.

The notes are stored in the given file in a plain text format, easy to edit
also from outside the program.  See the section about the pdfpc format below.

.SS Overview mode

Pressing tab you can enter the overview mode, where miniatures for the slides
are shown.  You can select one slide to jump to with the mouse or with the
arrow keys.  You can also define overlays and the end slide (see next sections)
in this mode.

.SS Overlays

Many slide preparation systems allow for overlays, i.e.  sets of slides that
are logically grouped together as a single, changing slide.  Examples include
enumerations where the single items are displayed one after another or rough
"animations", where parts of a picture change from slide to slide.  Pdf
Presenter Console includes facilities for dealing with such overlays.

In this description, we will differentiate between slides (i.e.  pages in the
pdf document) and "user slides", that are the logical slides.  The standard
forward movement command (page down, enter, etc.) moves through one slide at a
time, as expected.  That means that every step in the overlay is traversed.
The backward movement command works differently depending if the current and
previous slides are part of an overlay:

.IP \[bu] 2
If the current slide is part of an overlay we just jump to the previous slide.
That means that we are in the middle of an overlay we can jump forward and
backward through the single steps of it
.IP \[bu] 2
If the current slide is not part of an overlay (or if it is the first one), but
the previous slides are, we jump to the previous user slide.  This means that
when going back in the presentation you do not have to go through every step of
the overlay, Pdf Presenter Console just shows the first slide of the each
overlay.  As you normally only go back in a presentation when looking for a
concrete slide, this is more convenient.
.PP

The up and down cursor keys work on a user slide basis.
You can use them to skip the rest of an overlay or to jump to the
previous user slide, ignoring the state of the current slide.

When going through an overlay, two additional previews may be activated
in the presenter view, just below the main view, showing the next and
the previous slide in an overlay.

Pdf Presenter Console tries to find these overlays automatically by looking
into the page labels in the pdf file.  For LaTeX this works correctly at least
with the beamer class and also modifying the page numbers manually (compiling
with pdflatex).  If your preferred slide-producing method does not work
correctly with this detection, you can supply this information using the o key
for each slide that is part of an overlay (except the first one!).  The page
numbering is also adapted.  This information is automatically stored.

.SS End slide
.PP
Some people like to have some additional, backup slides after the last
slide in the actual presentation.
Things like bibliographic references or slides referring to specialized
questions are typical examples.
Pdf Presenter Console lets you define which is the last slide in the
actual presentation vie the \[aq]e\[aq] key.
This just changes the progress display in the presenter screen, as to
have a better overview of how many slides are left.
.SS pdfpc Files
.PP
The notes and other additional information are stored in a file with the
extension "pdfpc".
When invoking Pdf Presenter Console with a non pdfpc file, it
automatically checks if there exists such a file and in this case loads
the additional information.
This means that you normally do not have to deal with this kind of files
explicitly.
.PP
There are however cases where you may want to edit the files manually.
The most typical case is if you add or remove some slides after you have
edited notes or defined overlays.
It may be quicker to edit the pdfpc file than to re-enter the whole
information.
Future versions may include external tools for dealing with this case
automatically.
.PP
The files are plain-text files that should be fairly self-explanatory.
A couple of things to note:
.IP \[bu] 2
The slide numbers of the notes refer to user slides
.IP \[bu] 2
The [notes] sections must be the last one in the file
.IP \[bu] 2
For the programmers out there: slide indexes start at 1

Additionally, $HOME/.pdfpcrc is also read, if present. Following commands are
aceepted
.TP
.B bind <key> <func>
Bind a key to a function
.TP
.B unbind <key>
Unbinds the given key
.TP
.B unbind_all
Unbinds all the keybindings
.TP
.B mouse <button> <func>
Binds a mouse button to a function
.TP

name.
.P
Key names can be obtained with the help of the xev utility. Note that
names are case sensitive. Modifiers can be specified in the form
<mod>+<key> where <mod> is one of S (for shift), C (for control) and
A/M (for Alt/Meta). E.g.
.TP
bind S+Next    next10
.P
A list of all possible functions can be obtained
via the \-L command line option.

Under
.I http://davvil.github.com/pdfpc#configs
you can find some configuration files for commonly used devices
(wireless presenters, bluetooth headsets, ...). If your device is not
yet supported and you generated a working config file, please
contribute it (see contact information below).

.SS Movies

Pdfpc can play back movies included in the PDF file.  Movies may be started
and stopped by clicking within their area.  For the presenter, a progress
bar is drawn along the bottom of the movie.  This expands when the mouse
hovers over it, allowing one to seek by clicking or dragging within the
progress bar.  Switching slides automatically stops playback, and movies
will be reset after leaving and returning to a slide.

Movies may be included in PDF files as "screen annotations".  pdfpc does
not yet support options that modify the playback of these movies.  In LaTeX,
such movies may be added to a presentation with the "movie15" package.
Note that the poster, autoplay, and repeat options are not yet supported.
(Also, run ps2pdf with the -dNOSAFER flag.)

As a perhaps simpler option, pdfpc will play back movies linked from a
hyperlink of type "launch".  A query string may be added to the URL of the
movie to enable the "autostart" and "loop" properties.  (E.g., a link to
"movie.avi?autostart&loop" will start playing automatically, and loop when
it reaches the end.)  In LaTeX, such links are created with

.RS
\\usepackage{hyperref}
.br
\\href{run:<movie file>}{<placeholder content>}
.RE

The movie will playback in the area taken by the placeholder content.  Using
a frame of the movie will ensure the correct aspect ratio.

.SH BUGS

There may be a small memory leak in the program. I am trying to solve it. It
should not be too important for up to some hundreds of slides.
