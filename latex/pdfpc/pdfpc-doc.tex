\begin{abstract}
This package provides  a convenient way to specify notes and to define certain
meta  properties  of the  presentation when used with
\href{https://pdfpc.github.io/}{PDF Presenter Console (\texttt{pdfpc}), a
GPLv2+ licensed multi-monitor PDF presentation viewer application available on
GitHub}\footnote{\url{https://pdfpc.github.io/}}.

\section*{Dependencies and other requirements}

\sty{pdfpc} requires the use of \LaTeXe.

It depends on the following packages:

\section*{Loading \sty{pdfpc}}

Load \sty{pdfpc} by adding \cmd{\usepackage\{pdfpc\}} to your preamble.

The following \param{options} may be given as comma-separated list:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{duration}
\item \texttt{starttime}
\item \texttt{endtime}
\item \texttt{enduserslide}
\item \texttt{lastminutes}
\item \texttt{hidenotes}
\item \texttt{overridenote}
\item \texttt{disablemarkdown}
\item \texttt{defaulttransition} (needs pdfpc v4.5 or higher)
\end{itemize}

The meaning and possible values of most of these options are documented in
\textit{pdfpcrc(5)} man page of the pdfpc program. The rest are explained below.

To add a note to a slide, use \cmd{\pdfpcnote\{Text of a note\}}. A line break
in the body of the note can be inserted with \cmd{\\}. The notes are rendered
according to the Markdown syntax by default. If you prefer the plain text format
(which was the case with \texttt{pdfpc}-4.4 and below), use the
\texttt{disablemarkdown} option.

The pdfpc package can be used standalone or together with beamer. In
the later case, it may be desirable to continue using the \cmd{\note}
command. To this end, the \texttt{overridenote} option should be provided.
Please note though, that this will work only in simple cases.

If you prefer using full-featured beamer notes rendered alongside the
presentation (\cmd{\setbeameroption\{show notes on second screen\}}), the pdfpc
package will autodetect it, so using the \texttt{--notes} command-line option is
unnecessary. To override the autodetection, use the \texttt{notesposition}
option, accepting the same values (right/left/top/bottom/none).

When sharing slides, one may want to omit the (private) notes, by using the
\texttt{hidenotes} option. Enabling it together with \texttt{overridenote} will
disable the beamer notes as well.
